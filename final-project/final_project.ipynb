    "In real-world studies, getting a truly representative random sample of the population is often incredibly difficult. Even just to accurately represent all Americans, a truly random sample would need to examine people across geographical, socioeconomic, community, and class lines (just to name a few). For a study like this, scientists would also need to make sure the medical exams were standardized and consistent across the different people being examined. In other words, there's a tradeoff between taking a more representative random sample and the cost of collecting more information from each person in the sample.\n",

    "The Framingham study collected high-quality medical data from its subjects, even if the subjects may not be a perfect representation of the population of all Americans. This is a common issue that data scientists face: while the available data aren't perfect, they're the best we have. The Framingham study is generally considered the best in its class, so we'll continue working with it while keeping its limitations in mind.\n",

    "To establish a causal link between saturated fat intake, serum cholesterol, and heart disease, a group of doctors in the US established the National Heart-Diet Study. The study was based in 6 centers: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oakland, and Faribault, MN. The first 5 centers recruited volunteers from the local population: volunteers and their families were asked to adjust their diet to include more or less saturated fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already have a strong intuition about what the doctors concluded in their findings, but the evidence from the trial was surprisingly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth center was organized by Dr. Ivan Frantz, and its study was known as the Minnesota Coronary Experiment. Dr. Frantz was a strong proponent of reducing saturated fats to prevent death from heart disease. He believed so strongly in the idea that he placed his household on a strict diet very low in saturated fats. The main difference between the Minnesota Coronary Experiment and the rest of the National Diet-Heart Study was the setting. While the other centers in the study looked at volunteers, Dr. Frantz conducted his study at Faribault State Hospital, which housed patients who were institutionalized due to disabilities or mental illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this institution, the subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups: half of the subjects, the **control group**, were fed meals cooked with saturated fats, and the other half, the **diet group**, were fed meals cooked with polyunsaturated fats. For example, the diet group's oils were replaced with corn oils and their butter was replaced with margarine. The subjects did not know which food they were getting, to avoid any potential bias or placebo effect. This type of study is known as a **blind** study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although standards for informed consent in participation weren't as strict then as they are today, the study was described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*No consent forms were required because the study diets were considered to be acceptable as house diets and the testing was considered to contribute to better patient care.  Prior to beginning the diet phase, the project was explained and sample foods were served. Residents were given the opportunity to decline participation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the level of detail and effort in the study, the results of the study were never extensively examined until the late 21st century. Over 40 years after the data were collected, Dr. Christopher Ramsden heard about the experiment, and asked Dr. Frantz's son Robert to uncover the files in the Frantz family home's dusty basement. You can learn more about the story of how the data was recovered on the [Revisionist History podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/20-the-basement-tapes) or in [Scientific American magazine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/records-found-in-dusty-basement-undermine-decades-of-dietary-advice/)."
